 Little things and pieces I make for fun or for projects. 

 # autoBrackets.js
 ```js
 fillBrackets(triggerElement)
 ```
 The fillBrackets() function receives the element that triggered it as an input -I reccomend you use ```onkeypress = ""```to call the function- and if the character that was input is an open bracket/quote, it fills it in.

 **Example**: if the input was ```(```, the function adds ```)``` after the cursor.

 My goal is to implement this into a Vencord plugin. I will post it in its own repo if I succeed
