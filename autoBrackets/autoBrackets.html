        <p>
           This is a proof of concept site I made. In that text field when you enter an opening bracket of any kind, the field will automatically complete it for you.
           if you enter a closing bracket after the opening one, it will be deleted. Oh and it kinda works with quotes too. It doesn't remove existing quotes though.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: green">Enjoy.</h3>
